? ERROR [Validation] (Warning - This VUID has now been reported 10 times, which is the duplicated_message_limit value, this will be the last time reporting it).
vkCmdDrawIndexed(): the descriptor [VkDescriptorSet 0x3b000000003b, Set 1, Binding 1, Index 1, variable "materialTextures"] is being used in draw but has never been updated via vkUpdateDescriptorSets() or a similar call.
The Vulkan spec states: Descriptors in each bound descriptor set, specified via vkCmdBindDescriptorSets, must be valid as described by descriptor validity if they are statically used by the VkPipeline bound to the pipeline bind point used by this command and the bound VkPipeline was not created with VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_BIT_EXT (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.321.1/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/drawing.html#VUID-vkCmdDrawIndexed-None-08114)
